### A program to encrypt/decrypt and modify Diablo III saves
Instructions:

- Hero and account edition: Hero level, Paragon level, Highest GR completed...
- Stash and Hero inventory viewing.

----

- Item edition.
- Item generation.
- Seasonal character creation

Help needed:
----
Help needed identifying the missing items and affixes.
If you find a missing item please report back.

No access to seasonal saves. A save with a seasonal character would help us reverse engineer how seasonal characters 
are defined. We already have a pretty good idea but don't want to waste time changing things that may not work.
